#Node Mongo

This is a RESTFUL Node JS API that uses MongoDB as its data store.

My first Node JS application - in continuous improvement.

Its a contacts list api that:
- Gets all contacts info
- Gets single info
- Saves to contacts list.
...more to come later

To run:

`npm run dev` to start the development environment which runs on port 3001 and on nodemon - meaning it auto-reloads when you make a change to the code, instead of stopping and restarting the server.
